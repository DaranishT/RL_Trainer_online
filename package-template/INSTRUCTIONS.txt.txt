1. DEPENDENCY CHECK - Verifies Python and Node.js
2. INSTALLATION - Installs required packages (first time only)
3. SERVER START - Opens two windows:
   - Python Server (WebSocket:8765) - AI training brain
   - Game Server (HTTP:3000) - 3D visualization
4. BROWSER OPEN - Automatically opens game page
5. TRAINING START - AI begins learning immediately

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

• Keep BOTH server windows open during training
• Training progress shows in the game browser tab
• Models automatically save to "training/models/"
